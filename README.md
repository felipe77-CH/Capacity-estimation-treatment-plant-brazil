# Capacity Estimation and Performance Projection of a Non-Conventional Liquids Treatment Plant in Brazil: Application of Environmental Data Analysis Techniques

The municipality of Belo Horizonte has experienced significant economic growth across various sectors, such as industry, commerce, and services, which has led to a notable increase in the production of industrial liquid waste. This growth has resulted in an increasing demand for liquid treatment systems, particularly those of an industrial nature, which are currently managed by private companies. These systems are crucial to ensuring compliance with environmental regulations and mitigating the negative impacts of industrial effluents on the environment and public health. As the city expands, the efficient management of these effluents becomes a priority for both local authorities and the involved companies.

The main objective of this study is to determine the nominal design capacity of an effluent treatment plant, using data provided by companies located in 11 municipalities in the Belo Horizonte metropolitan area. To this end, the production volumes and effluents generated by these companies will be analyzed, allowing for the simulation of various load and demand curves. These simulations will provide an accurate projection of the plant's receiving capacity, adjusted to the anticipated demand over time. This approach will help identify the necessary infrastructure to ensure the plant can handle the increasing volumes of industrial waste without compromising its operational efficiency.

Additionally, a process of georeferencing industrial activities in the region was carried out. This step is essential for identifying the locations of effluent-generating sources and assessing the accessibility of treatment plants in terms of distance and transportation time. By calculating the average transportation cost of effluents, the overall economic cost associated with treating non-conventional liquids can be estimated. This calculation is crucial for companies, as it will allow them to make informed decisions about their waste management strategies and optimize operational costs.

Georeferencing also provides key information for optimizing the transportation routes for effluents to treatment plants. With a detailed analysis of the locations of industries and plants, more efficient transportation routes can be designed, which not only reduces logistical costs but also minimizes the risks associated with transporting hazardous liquids within the urban area. This includes reducing transportation times, contributing to better time management and a lower risk of accidents during the transportation of these wastes.

Furthermore, georeferencing allows for the estimation of the average effective transportation time, which is key to optimizing the logistics of the treatment process. Improving transportation efficiency will not only reduce operational costs but also decrease the environmental impact associated with the carbon footprint generated by transportation trucks. This analysis will enable authorities and companies to develop an integrated strategy for managing industrial effluents that is both economically viable and environmentally responsible.
